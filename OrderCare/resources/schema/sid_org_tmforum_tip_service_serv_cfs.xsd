      Model Description:
      Model Project for SID xsd generation
      Package Description:
      The Service ABE contains entities that are used to represent two fundamentally different types of Services, called CustomerFacingServices and ResourceFacingServices.

A CustomerFacingService defines the characteristics and behavior of a particular Service as seen by the Customer or other appropriate PartyRole. In contrast, a ResourceFacingService is an abstraction that defines the characteristics and behavior of a particular Service that is not directly seen or purchased by the PartyRole. ResourceFacingServices are "internal" Services that are required to support a CustomerFacingService.

Entities in this ABE provide different views to examine, analyze, configure, monitor and repair Services of all types. Entities in this ABE are derived from Service Specification entities.

            <p>This is an abstract base class that is the parent for different types of traffic conditioning services defined in the DEN-ng Service model. TrafficConditioningServices are one example of a ResourceFacingService, in that the Customer is not able to control them. In fact, the Customer is not even aware that they are there. However, they must be implemented in order for different CoSs to be differentiated from each other, and hence for different Customers to receive different CoSs.

Please see the DEN-ng Service model for more details.</p>

            <p>A CustomerFacingService defines the properties of a particular related Service that represents a realization of a Product within an organization's infrastructure; This is in direct contrast to ResourceFacingServices, which support the network/infrastructure facing part of the service. For example, a VPN is an example of a CustomerFacingService, while the sub-services that perform different types of routing between network devices making up the VPN are examples of ResourceFacingServices.

CustomerFacingServices are directly related to Products as well as to ResourceFacingServices. ResourceFacingServices are indirectly related to Products through the relationship between Product and CustomerFacingServices. This enforces the relationship to Products while keeping Services that are not directly realized by Products (i.e., ResourceFacingServices) separated from Products.</p>

                        <p>This is an enumerated integer that defines the status of this particular CustomerFacingService. Values include:

0: Operational and billable
1: Degraded but billable
2: In Violation and billable
3: Operational but not billable
4: In Test and not billable
5: Being Deployed and not billable
6: Failed

Value 0 means that this CustomerFacingService is acting per specification, and is fully billable.

Value 1 means that this CustomerFacingService is operational, but is currently in a degraded state. However, it has not violated any contractual specification and is fully billable.

Value 2 means that this CustomerFacingService is operational, but is currently in violation of its associated contractual specification(s). Whether it is billable or not is determined by its associated Policy for handling service violations.

Value 3 means that this CustomerFacingService is currently operational, but has not been enabled for this particular customer yet and is therefore not billable for this customer.

Value 4 means that this CustomerFacingService is currently being tested, and is not yet ready to be enabled for this particular customer. Consequently, it is therefore not billable for this customer.

Value 5 means that this CustomerFacingService is currently being deployed, and therefore has not been enabled for this particular customer yet. Consequently, it is therefore not billable for this customer.

Value 6 means that this CustomerFacingService has currently failed. The set of actions that should be taken, as well as whether this service can still be billed or not, are determined by its associated Policy for handling service violations.</p>

            <p>A ServicePackage is derived from an associated ServicePackageSpec. The ServicePackageSpec defines the invariant attributes, methods, relationships, and constraints for all ServicePackage instances that are derived from it. This enables each individual ServicePackage to add its own application-specific changeable characteristics and behavior.

Note that there is no specific aggregation used to relate a particular ServicePackage to the ServicePackageSpec that it is derived from. This is because the ServicePackageSpec and ServicePackage both inherit the SpecifiesService aggregation, and at this (the business level) view, there are no new semantics that are required to represent this relationship.

Finally, while the composite pattern could be applied to ServicePackage, there is no perceived need to do so. Multiple ServicePackages will simply be aggregated by a ProductBundle, and appear as separate ProductComponents.</p>

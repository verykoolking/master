                        <p>This is an enumerated integer whose value indicates the current status of this category of capacity object. The category is the name of the subclass. For example, the PhysicalMemoryCapacity subclass inherits the Status attribute, so the status applies to this instance of PhysicalMemory. The following values are defined:

0: Unknown
1: OK
2: Initializing
3: Starting
4: Paused
5: Stopping
6: Stopped
7: Degraded
8: Stressed
9: Critical
10: Predicted Failure
11: Error - General
12: Error - Non Recoverable
13: Not Installed or Not Present
14: In Maintenance
15: Unable To Contact
16: Lost Communications

Stopped indicates that the object is known still exist, but it is no longer operational. However, it has not failed. Stressed indicates that the object is functioning, but needs attention (e.g., it may be overheating, or overloaded in some way). Predicted Failure indicates that this object is functioning properly but predicting a failure in the near future.

In Maintenance describes an object that is being configured, maintained, or otherwise administered and is NOT available for service. Unable To Contact indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this object but has never been able to establish communications with it. Lost Commmunications indicates that the object has been contacted successfully in the past and is known to still exist; however, it is currently unreachable.

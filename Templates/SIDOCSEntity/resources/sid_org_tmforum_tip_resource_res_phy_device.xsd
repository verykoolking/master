            <p>This is an abstract base class for representing hardware devices that can be managed. This class represents a convenient aggregation point for combining different aspects of a device (e.g., the cables, connectors, cards, power supplies, and other objects that together make up the device). Thus, it enables the device itself to have a physical manifestation (e.g., the "Internet Gateway Router" can be identified as a PhysicalDevice). Examples of this class include routers and switches, computers, and other end-devices that are managed.</p>

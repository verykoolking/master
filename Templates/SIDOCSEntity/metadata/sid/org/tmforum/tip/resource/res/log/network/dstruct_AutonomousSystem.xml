    <p>An Autonomous System (AS) provides a structured view of routing by segregating the system that is using routing (e.g., the Internet, a corporate intranet, or a company extranet) into a set of separately administered domains that each has their own independent routing policies.    The classic definition of an AS, from RFC1771, is '...a set of routers under a single technical administration, using an interior gateway protocol and common metrics to route packets within the AS, and using an exterior gateway protocol to route packets to other ASs. Since this classic definition was developed, it has become common for a single AS to use several interior gateway protocols and sometimes several sets of metrics within an AS. The use of the term Autonomous System here stresses the fact that, even when multiple IGPs and metrics are used, the administration of an AS appears to other ASs to have a single coherent interior routing plan and presents a consistent picture of what destinations are reachable through it.'</p>                <p>This entity  is  optional</p>

        <p>This is a boolean that, when its value is TRUE, indicates that this AS must obey the following BGP rule: a BGP router should not advertise destinations learned from internal BGP neighbors to external BGP destinations unless those destinations are also known via some internal gateway protocol. Otherwise, a BGP router may receive traffic that cannot yet be routed. However, since this is a costly choice, it is common practice to allow this rule to be broken under certain carefully controlled circumstances.</p>                                <p>This element is generated from an attribute.</p>                                <p>This attribute  is  optional</p>

        <p>This refers to summarizing ranges of routes into one or more aggregate routes. This is done to minimize the number of routes in the global routing table. A potential drawback is that specific path information (e.g., AS_Path attribute value) is lost, which may lead to potential routing loops. There are a variety of ways to ensure that this does not happen. Note, however, that BGP4 is required to do this.        There are many ways to form aggregate routes. The following are the most popular: 'Aggregate only', where only the aggregate is advertised, and all of its more specific routes are suppressed; 'Aggregate and Include Specific Routes', where both the aggregate as well as its more specific routes are advertised (e.g., send the aggregate to the NAP, but send the more specific routes to providers); 'Aggregate Based on a Subset of Specific Routes', where the aggregate route is formed by looking at certain more specific routes and forming an aggregate on them, suppressing all others. Values include:        0: Unknown        1: None        2: Aggregate Only        3: Aggregate and Include Specific Routes        4: Aggregate Based on Subset of Specific Routes</p>                                <p>This element is generated from an attribute.</p>                                <p>This attribute  is  optional</p>

        <p>This defines how routing information is to be injected. Statically injected routes are maintained by the routing table and are independent of the status of the networks that they refer to. This is done by defining static routes in the routing table. Dynamically injected routes are of two types. Dynamic routes refer to distributing all of the IGP routes into the AS. Semi-dynamic routes define a set of specific IGP routes that will be injected into the AS. Values include:        0: Unknown        1: Static        2: Dynamic        3: Semi-Dynamic</p>                                <p>This element is generated from an attribute.</p>                                <p>This attribute  is  optional</p>
